Hello!

This is the bridge for LINE and Matrix,

to communicate with the chat room which belongs to both of the different providers.

The bridge is using [line-bot-sdk-python](https://github.com/line/line-bot-sdk-python) and [matrix-nio](https://github.com/poljar/matrix-nio) for transporting.

[Instruction of Matrix Bridges](https://matrix.org/bridges/)

This is the documentation for Arona, the perfectest bridging for every messenger.
